The staff quarters is dilapidated and needs a total rehabilitation by replacing the roofs  ceilings  door and windows. The PHC is too big to have just a staff serving as both the midwife and the nurse on duty  moreso the community residents are not helping matters as per patronage of the PHC which could be the reason for the non availability of staff but with a medical orientation if organized in the community can bring restoration to the Centre."

The centre also needs more staffs to enable an effective service delivery in the health post.",
  "General Comments About the PHC": "The health post generally is supposed to be equipped topnotch being that it's situated in a MOPOL Base in the heart of the capital city of Anambra state but the site and state of the Health post is not something to write home about... There is just one small room serving as the ward and another room serving both as the waiting room  consulting room  pharmacy and every other activity is being conducted within the small space of the health post... Currently there's an extension work on the structure currently on the roofing level but roofing is yet to start."
